This file will contain information for the user named "example-user-name"

We need to decided how this will be formatted. It will def be a CSV file but we need to decide how the fields will work.

Kevin's thought of how to format:
GUID, GUID, GUID, GUID, GUID
Where each GUID will be the GUID for a searchable(aka a Song or a Release or an Artist).  We then add each searchable to the library for each person.
